# Gosl. fun. data subdirectory

This directory contains auxiliary data files for testing.

The files starting with "as-" correspond to results from (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1972) [1]

The .txt files are tables for visual inspection of results whereas .cmp files are for automatic
"unit testing".

The .py files can be used to re-generate all tables (using SciPy).
